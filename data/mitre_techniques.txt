Title: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter
Description: Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways to interact with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of Unix shell while Windows installations include the Windows Command Shell and PowerShell.
Tactics: Execution
Impact: Adversaries may leverage these interpreters to execute malicious code, possibly allowing them to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or move laterally within a network.

Title: T1078 Valid Accounts
Description: Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and external services, such as Web mail and VPNs.
Tactics: Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion
Impact: Allows attackers to blend in with legitimate user activity, making detection difficult.

Title: T1071 Application Layer Protocol
Description: Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.
Tactics: Command and Control
Impact: Enables covert communication and data exfiltration.
